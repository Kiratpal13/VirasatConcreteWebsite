                        <h3>Why Choose Concrete for Calgary Sidewalks & Steps?</h3>
                        <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 1rem;">
                            <li><strong>Code Compliance:</strong> We build to Alberta Building Code and City of Calgary bylaws, ensuring proper dimensions, load capacity, and safety features that pass inspections.</li>
                            <li><strong>Freeze-Thaw Resistance:</strong> Our concrete mixes include air entrainment (6-8% air content) specifically engineered for Calgary's extreme temperature swings from -40°C to +35°C.</li>
                            <li><strong>Proper Drainage:</strong> All walkways sloped minimum 2% away from foundations, steps designed with positive drainage to prevent ice buildup and water infiltration.</li>
                            <li><strong>Safety First:</strong> Non-slip broom finishes, proper tread depth, code-compliant risers, and strategically placed control joints minimize trip hazards.</li>
                            <li><strong>Deep Footings:</strong> Steps anchored on footings below frost line (minimum 4 feet deep) to prevent heaving, settling, or separation from the house.</li>
                            <li><strong>Long-Lasting:</strong> Properly installed concrete sidewalks last 30+ years and steps last 25-30 years with minimal maintenance—far outlasting wood, pavers, or asphalt.</li>
                            <li><strong>Low Maintenance:</strong> No yearly staining like wood decks, no shifting pavers, no weed growth—just occasional cleaning and sealing every 3-4 years.</li>
                            <li><strong>Versatile Finishes:</strong> Choose from broom finish, exposed aggregate, stamped patterns, colored concrete, or smooth trowel to match your home's style.</li>
                            <li><strong>Increases Home Value:</strong> Well-maintained walkways and safe entry steps improve curb appeal and can increase property value by 5-8%.</li>

                            <p>For residential sidewalks and walkways on private property, permits are typically NOT required. However, permits ARE required for: public sidewalk replacement (City of Calgary permit), steps that structurally attach to your house foundation, basement entry stairs (safety permit), and wheelchair ramps (to ensure accessibility code compliance). When replacing public sidewalks adjacent to your property, you must notify the city and obtain a permit—improper installation can result in fines and forced removal. We're familiar with all Calgary permit requirements and can guide you through the process or handle applications on your behalf.</p>

                            <p>Concrete sidewalk costs in Calgary range from $8-15 per square foot depending on width, finish, and site access. A typical 30-foot front walkway (3 feet wide) costs $700-$1,350. Concrete steps cost $150-400 per step depending on width, depth, and finish—a standard 4-step front entry typically costs $600-$1,600. Basement walk-out stairs (8-10 steps) run $2,000-$4,500 due to deeper excavation and heavier reinforcement. Decorative finishes (stamped, exposed aggregate) add $3-6/sq ft. Prices include excavation, base preparation, forms, rebar, concrete, finishing, and sealing. Difficult access, extensive removal, or complex designs may increase costs.

                            <p>Alberta Building Code requires: maximum riser height of 7.75 inches (196mm), minimum tread depth of 10 inches (254mm), and all risers/treads must be uniform within 3/8 inch. Steps must have handrails if there are more than 3 risers, handrail height 34-38 inches, and handrails must return to wall or extend horizontally. Minimum width is 36 inches for residential entry stairs. Footings must extend below frost line (4-5 feet in Calgary). Steps must slope forward slightly (1-2%) for water drainage. Exterior steps require slip-resistant finish (broom texture minimum). We build all steps to exceed these requirements, ensuring safety and code compliance that passes inspections.</p>

                            <p>Timeline depends on project size. Simple sidewalk replacement (20-40 linear feet): 1-2 days total—Day 1 for removal, excavation, base prep, and pour; Day 2 for sealing after initial cure. Entry steps (3-5 steps): 2-3 days—Day 1 for excavation and footing pour, Day 2 for step forming and pour, Days 3-7 for curing. Larger projects like basement walk-out stairs: 3-5 days due to deeper excavation and more complex forming. You can walk on walkways after 24-48 hours (light traffic only) and steps after 48-72 hours, but wait 7 days before heavy use and 28 days for full cure. We'll protect the area with caution tape during the cure period.</p>

                            <span>Why do concrete steps crack or separate from the house?</span>
                            <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>

                            <p>The most common cause is shallow footings that don't extend below the frost line (4-5 feet in Calgary). When soil freezes and expands, it lifts steps upward (frost heave), causing cracks and separation. Other causes include: no rebar reinforcement, attaching steps rigidly to house foundation (differential movement causes cracking), inadequate base compaction causing settling, poor drainage allowing water to pool under steps and freeze, and using low-quality concrete without air entrainment. We prevent these issues by digging footings to proper depth, using steel rebar grids, installing isolation joints between steps and foundation, ensuring positive drainage, and using Calgary-grade air-entrained concrete. Properly built steps should last 25-30 years without cracking.</p>

                            <p>Yes, with proper cold-weather techniques. When temperatures are 0°C to 10°C, we use accelerated concrete mixes, heated water, insulated blankets, and temporary enclosures to maintain proper curing temperatures. Concrete must stay above 5°C for 48 hours and above 0°C for 7 days. We do NOT pour when temperatures drop below -5°C or during active precipitation. Winter pours cost 10-20% more due to additional materials and labor. However, the best time for sidewalk and step installation is May through October when ground isn't frozen, excavation is easier, and warm temperatures ensure optimal curing. Spring (April-May) is popular for homeowners wanting projects done before summer entertaining season.</p>

                            <p>Maintenance is minimal. Sweep regularly to remove debris and prevent staining. Wash with mild soap and water 1-2 times per year—avoid pressure washers on steps (can erode surface). NEVER use deicing salts (sodium chloride, calcium chloride) on concrete—they cause surface scaling and deterioration. Use sand, kitty litter, or calcium magnesium acetate (CMA) instead. Reseal every 3-4 years with quality penetrating sealer to protect against moisture intrusion and freeze-thaw damage. Use plastic snow shovels, not metal (prevents gouging). Fill any cracks immediately with concrete crack filler to prevent water infiltration. Trim vegetation away from edges to prevent root damage. With proper care, sidewalks last 30+ years and steps last 25-30 years.</p>

                            <p>REPLACE if: concrete is heaved more than 1 inch (trip hazard and unfixable), cracks are wider than 1/4 inch or numerous (structural failure), surface is extensively scaled/pitted (moisture damage, will worsen), steps have separated from foundation (footing failure), or concrete is older than 30 years (likely lacks air entrainment). REPAIR if: minor hairline cracks (under 1/8 inch), isolated small chips/spalls (cosmetic only), or slight settling (can be mud-jacked/lifted). We provide honest assessments—if repairs will only last 2-3 years, we recommend replacement for better long-term value. DIY repairs (crack fillers, resurfacers) are temporary fixes that don't address underlying structural issues like inadequate footings or missing rebar.</p>

                            <p>Each material has pros and cons. Concrete steps offer the best value ($150-400/step), longest lifespan (25-30 years), lowest maintenance (just sealing every 3-4 years), excellent Calgary weather durability, and can be finished to look like stone. Wood steps cost $200-600/step, require yearly staining/waterproofing, are slippery when wet/icy, rot in Calgary's moisture cycles, and last only 10-15 years. Natural stone steps cost $400-1,000/step, look premium but can crack from freeze-thaw, require expert installation, and can be dangerously slippery without texture. For Calgary's climate, safety requirements, and most budgets, concrete steps provide the best combination of affordability, durability, safety (non-slip finishes), and low maintenance.</p>
